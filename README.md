## CPD Coursework â€“ Face Comparison Project

This serverless application processes images uploaded to an S3 bucket. When a new image is uploaded, it compares the detected face(s) to those in a predefined group photo using AWS Rekognition. If a match is found, a notification is sent via SNS.

This project is designed as part of the Cloud Platform Development coursework to demonstrate understanding of AWS services.
